Data from Devin McPhillips via e-mail on 7/13/2022, subject "RI table". According to Devin, "This has been bureau approved and accepted pending minor revision at SRL, which were submitted yesterday."

Updated on 7/15/2022 by Kevin Milner with the following modifications:

* Increased precision of site locations for prior sites used in UCERF3 using UCERF3 data file (typically 2 decimal places to 4)
* Used exact location for 18th Ave SSAF site from Castillo et al., (2021, doi: 10.1130/GES02237.1). Note that rounding was slightly off in Devin's table for the longitude value (-116.538 was erroneously rounded to -116.59)
* Moved location of 1000 Palms site to location on Mill Creek, crossreferencing location mapped in Figure 2 of Fumal et al. (2002, doi: 10.1785/0120000609) with Google maps: 33.8376,-116.3094
